# Week 1
For this week we started off by creating the team contract and deciding on the basic logistics of our group during this project. Additionally, we created the initial draft of our proposal. We spent the rest of the week looking into the best way for us to create a graph class and ingest our data set from its text file. Finally, we continued to do research on our chosen algorithms to plan on future implementation.
