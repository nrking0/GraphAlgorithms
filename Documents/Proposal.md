# Final Project Proposal

## Leading Question
* How can we find the shortest path between webpage nodes and also rank them on their popularity?
* Given any two specific web pages, what is the exact list of webpages in the shortest path between those two pages?
* What are the top ten webpages based on our pagerank algorithm?

## Dataset Acquisition and Processing
* For our dataset, we will be using the web-Google dataset from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. 
* We will download the dataset from the above webpage and store it as a file in our repo.
* We will parse the text file into an adjacency list that stores the nodes and edges.
* We will make a map where the first entry is a node, and the second entry is a vector of all the nodes that the first entry has a directed edge towards.
* Using an adjacency list should be more space-effective than a matrix of all the nodes.
* The dataset may have webpages that do not contain links to anywhere else, so these entries of our map will have empty vectors as their second entries.

## Graph Algorithms
* Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
* Given two specific nodes, we will return the shortest number of edges needed to go from the first given edge to the second given edge.
* Page Rank
* Given a graph, we will return a list of pages ranked based on popularity. Popularity refers to the number of edges connected to a node and the ranking of those    connected nodes. 
* To use the Google page rank algorithm, we will need to construct a Markov matrix from our adjacency list to represent the probabilities of the nodes that a        given node could go to.
